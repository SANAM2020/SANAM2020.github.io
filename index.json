We conducted the first large-scale comparative lab study of FIDO2 passwordless authentication with 94 participants. Our results show that passwordless authentication was perceived as more usable and was more accepted than password-based authentication. Our work motivates future research. First, user support and guidance for scalable account recovery is needed. Second, support for authenticator revocation without prior recovery is needed. Third, users need to be made aware of (individual) corner cases to adapt their authentication strategies. Fourth, FIDO2 offers a great opportunity to tailor authenticator form and features for a personalized authentication. Fifth, UX designers should establish mental models about passwordless authentication by drawing from existing models about physical keys. Motivation Here I would like to explain one of my projects about a comparative usability study of FDIO2 passwordless authentication. So, what is FIDO2? FIDO2 is a new authentication standard that was jointly developed by the FIDO Alliance, an open industry association that includes Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, VISA, plus more than 200 other organizations, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organization for the web.\nIn a nutshell, FIDO2 consists of two protocols, WebAuthn and CTAP2, that together allow a relying party1, like a web service, to make use of hardware authenticators, like security keys, for user authentication. FIDO2 supports two-factor and multi-factor authentication, but also single factor authentication in which the hardware authenticator is the only factor. This single factor, passwordless authentication has recently received a lot of attention. For instance, the media has declared FIDO2 passwordless authentication as the killer of password and the future king of user authentication on the web. So, we were wondering if FIDO2 is the kingslayer of web authentication?\nMore concretely, we wanted to find answers to the following research questions:\nAre users accepting FIDO2 passwordless authentication?\nHow do users perceive FIDO2 passwordless authentication in terms of usability?\nWhat thoughts and concerns arise in the users’ minds when using FIDO2 1FA?\nTo answer these questions, we conducted the first large-scale comparative user study of FIDO2 passwordless authentication. We recruited 94 participants, which we randomly distributed between a password control group Group$_{\\textrm{Pass}}$ (48 participants) and passwordless authentication group Group$_{\\textrm{1FA}}$ (46 participants). While the control group used regular text-based passwords for web authentication, the passwordless authentication group used a Yubico Security Key as the single factor for authentication.\nMethodology The exact methodology of our lab study was as follows, and we explain the individual steps for each group below.\nMethodology of our lab study Welcome and Topic Introduction For both groups, after we welcomed our participant and gave study instructions, the participant watched a short introduction video about password-based authentication in which we recapped well known benefits and drawbacks of text-based passwords.\nAfterwards, each group went through a dedicated steps.\nGroup$_{\\textrm{Pass}}$ After the introduction video, our control group (Group$_{\\textrm{Pass}}$) proceeded directly to a hands-on task where they had to register accounts on mock websites and login to those accounts by using regular text-based passwords for web authentication. Our mock websites Fakebook and Schmoogle were based on the Facebook and Google Mail sites to provide our participants with a familiar site and reduce the impact of confounding factors when learning to deal with a new website.\nSchmoogle website Afterwards, we asked participants to reflect on this experience in a survey. The usability and the acceptance of the authentication mechanisms as well as user-specific factors that may affect these variables were measured using standardized methods like SUS score or Affinity for Technology Interaction. In order to get a more complete picture of user perception, we also used free text questions to capture the ideas, benefits, drawbacks, and concerns that our participants see.\nGroup$_{\\textrm{1FA}}$ Our passwordless authentication group (Group$_{\\textrm{1FA}}$) proceeded differently after the topic introduction. Prior studies have shown that a lack of clarity about functionality and security benefits of authentication methods leads to a lower security rating, lower acceptance, and reluctance to switch to a new authentication method. We decided for our study design to address this lack through an introduction of passwordless authentication and showing how to use the security key before letting our participants try out passwordless authentication themselves.
